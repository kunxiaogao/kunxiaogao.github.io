## Identifying Early Markers of Alzheimer’s Disease through Longitudinal Speech Analysis
03/2024 – Present · Center for Speech and Language Processing, JHU (Advisors: Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Najim Dehak)  
- Build longitudinal acoustic + linguistic pipelines (Llama3, Wav2Vec 2.0) to detect pre-diagnosis cognitive decline.  
- Curated 5k+ recordings up to 10 years pre-diagnosis; applied diarization, denoising, and segment filtering for clinical quality.  
- Train classifiers (SVM, XGBoost, MLPs) and perform longitudinal statistics to reveal pause patterns, pitch variation, and syntactic complexity as early markers, reaching 0.80 accuracy pre-diagnosis.

## GNN Efficiency Improvements via Graph Sampling
02/2023 – Present · Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics, JHU (Advisor: Luana Ruiz)  
- Design GNNs for correlation network prediction with reduced computational cost while maintaining accuracy.  
- Evaluate leverage-score and BFS-inspired sampling to form compact representative graphs, training on sampled structures and validating on full Graph Shift Operators.  
- Provide Lipschitz graphon analysis showing leverage-based sampling yields tighter error bounds than uniform sampling; achieved ~26.8% lower MSE than traditional strategies.

## Knowledge Graph Construction with PubMedBERT
01/2023 – 06/2023 · Amgen, UC Santa Barbara (Advisor: Maxim Ivanov)  
- Fine-tuned PubMedBERT for biomedical NER (BioRED), reaching robust precision/recall on unseen corpora to power drug-repurposing knowledge graphs.  
- Automated entity/relationship extraction to refresh Amgen KGs with up-to-date biomedical literature.

## Additional research-led projects
- Machine Learning in Medical Applications (EEG MIL models, 86%+ accuracy for harmful brain activity).  
- Machine Translation (hybrid statistical/neural French→English, Metropolis–Hastings beam search).  
- Data Science Capstone (regression, RF, NLP, clustering for ASD biomarkers, fraud risk, and socio-economic segmentation).
