I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Emily Mower Provost](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~emilykmp/). My work bridges speech and language processing, affective computing, and clinical machine learning to surface interpretable biomarkers that support early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative and mental health conditions. Previously, I completed an M.S.E. in Data Science at Johns Hopkins University with [Prof. Najim Dehak](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/najim-dehak/) and [Prof. Laureano Moro Velazquez](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/laureano-moro-velazquez/), and a B.Sc. in Statistics and Data Science at UC Santa Barbara.

## Research focus
- Multidimensional emotion representation learning from speech and language
- Natural language processing for speech-based mental health symptom severity modeling
- Emotion detection through multimodal language processing and deep learning methods
