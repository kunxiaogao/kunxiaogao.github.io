I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by [Prof. Emily Mower Provost](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~emilykmp/). My work bridges speech and language processing, affective computing, and clinical machine learning to surface interpretable biomarkers that support early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative and mental health conditions. Previously, I completed an M.S.E. in Data Science at Johns Hopkins University with [Prof. Najim Dehak](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/najim-dehak/) and [Prof. Laureano Moro Velazquez](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/laureano-moro-velazquez/), and a B.Sc. in Statistics and Data Science at UC Santa Barbara.

## Research focus
- Longitudinal modeling of speech and language for early Alzheimer’s disease markers
- Multimodal paralinguistics for emotion, cognition, and clinical assessment
- Efficient graph learning and sampling for large-scale neuro/health datasets
