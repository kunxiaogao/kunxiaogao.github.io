SELECTED ACADEMIC & PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Identifying Early Markers of Alzheimer's Disease through Longitudinal Analysis of Language and
Speech Patterns 03/2024 - Present
Supervisor: Associate Prof. Laureano Moro-Velazquez and Assistant Prof. Najim Dehak, Center for
Speech and Language Processing, JHU
 Investigated early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection using longitudinal speech analysis,
incorporating both acoustic and linguistic features for binary classification and identifying prodromal
cognitive decline markers.
 Collected a balanced dataset with over 5,000 recordings, spanning up to 10 years pre-diagnosis,
ensuring quality through noise reduction, diarization, and segment filtering.
 Extracted acoustic and linguistic features, utilizing advanced models (Llama3, Wav2Vec 2.0, and so
on) to generate both interpretable and non-interpretable features for detecting early AD signs.
 Developed and tested classification models (SVM, XGBoost, MLPs and so on), performed
longitudinal statistical analysis, identifying significant speech markers related to pauses, pitch
variation, and syntactic complexity of early AD for clinical applications in detection and monitoring.
 Achieved peak classification accuracy of 0. 80 in pre-diagnosis speech patterns using NIFMs,
indicating their effectiveness in capturing subtle linguistic and acoustic signs of AD.

GNN Efficiency Improvements by Using Graph Sampling Strategies 02/2023 - Present
Supervisor: Assistant Prof. Luana Ruiz, AMS department, JHU
 Developed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for correlation network prediction, optimizing
computational efficiency while preserving predictive accuracy.
 Employed graph signal sampling techniques, testing strategies such as highest leveraging scores and
adapted BFS, to construct a smaller, representative graph.Trained the GNN on the reduced graph,
ensuring convergence through mathematical derivation and evaluating performance with a Graph
Shift Operator (GSO) on the full dataset.
 Applied mathematical derivations using Lipschitz continuous graphons W to establish error bounds
for non-uniform sampling strategies. Specifically, derived that sampling the top n nodes based on
leverage scores results in better convergence compared to uniform random sampling with small
exponential decay rate a.
 Achieved effective predictions, almost equal to the results from the model trained on original graph,
with reduced computational costs, demonstrating that a well-sampled smaller graph can outperform
traditional graph sampling methods, which achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error about 0.3 0 , 26.8%
lower than the traditional one.

Glodon - Beijing, China 06/2023 - 08/


Data Scientist Intern
 Aimed to predict customer purchasing behavior and provide customer data with high purchasing
power.
 Cleaned the data and developed a fuzzy matching algorithm by using jieba tokenizer and regexp to
acquire the 200 most popular words which will be ruled out from the perfect matching stage to create
the term match table.
 Combined the customer and base data frames on match table and wrote the aggregation back-tracking
algorithm by retrieving the data in certain time intervals before different specific dates for each id and
aggregated the data frame by project types, budgets, etc. for each time interval.
 Implemented XGBoost model with Randomized Search and Bayesian Optimization to train model
and fine-tuned the hyper-parameters, like tree depth and maximum leaf nodes, acquiring the best
model base on 65.893 AUC.
 Evaluated the model on test dataset, drew ROC and K-S curve to ensure no overfitting with
approximately 66% AUC.

Amgen Knowledge Graphs Based on PubMedBERT model 01/2023 - 06/
Supervisor: Dr. Maxim Ivanov, Amgen, University of California, Santa Barbara
 Applied NLP and text-mining algorithms to automate the creation and updating of Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), for drug repurposing by extracting relationships among biomedical entities.
 Replicated the BERT model from the BioRED paper and benchmarked performance. Fine-tuned
PubMedBERT on the BioRED dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and achieved high
precision (62%) and recall (75%) on unseen datasets, confirming its robustness across varied
biomedical text sources.
 Completed data preprocessing tasks and trained fine-tuned models using Amgen’s database,
leveraging the pretrained PubMedBERT model for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

OTHER PROJECT EXPERIENCE

Instructor: Associate Prof. Laureano Moro-Velazquez, JHU
 Created a classification model for harmful brain activity using EEG and spectrogram data from the
Harvard Challenge, achieving an accuracy of over 86.04%.
 Converted EEG signals to spectrograms, organized electrode data into four panels, and applied Fourier
Transforms to improve data visualization and interpretability.
 Implemented ResNet and EfficientNet with Multiple instance learning, dividing each EEG embedding
into four horizontal windows, creating distinct sub-segments for each instance in the dataset, which
allowed the model to treat each window as a separate “instance” within a larger EEG ‘bag,’ thereby
enabling it to identify meaningful patterns across different portions of the signal, to address challenges
in EEG signal variability, finding EfficientNet effective for multi-scale information.
 Compared and tuned MIL tune hyperparameter on dev set, identifying optimal kernel and stride
settings to enhance model adaptability and accuracy, with applications for seizure and harmful brain
activity detection, advancing automated medical diagnostics.
